Write a Python Program to calculate the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Description The program takes a string and calculates the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Solution 1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a digit is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a character is encountered. 4. Print the total count of both the variables. 5. Exit.

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of a string

Output consists of two integers.

First output refers to the total count of the characters.

Second output refers to the total count of the digits.

Sample Input & Output:

Characters = 6

Digits = 4

#python
n=input()
c=0
d=0
for i in range(len(n)):
    if n[i].isalpha():
        c=c+1
    elif n[i].isdigit():
        d=d+1
        
print("Characters =",c)
print("Digits =",d)
